As far as I can remember, I was always interested in web-based solutions begin with websites.
The most obvious choice was to start with the LAMP stack so I got familiar with PHP at first.
I use this programming language to this day and I try to keep up with the changes and with the new libraries written in this language.

In my recent job I got to know Go programming language, and I am comfortable with it so I make some time to learn about it.

And not too long ago I started to learn Python because I really know that PHP has it's own difficulties. I could imagine to work in Python soon.

I look for other stuff than programming languages like architecture, agile methods, standard solutions, UNIX systems.
As I mentioned in my job section I designed and implemented architectures and I learnt a lot there but I know I could learn about it more with other problems/circumstances.

My first thought about agile methods that they make development more effective which means we can work less but do more.
I think it's a good reason to learn about them and always reassess our work flow.
With these we can spare time for some more interesting things like looking for new technologies or creating standard solutions and share them in open communities.
