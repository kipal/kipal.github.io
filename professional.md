As far as I can remember, I've always been interested in web-based solutions.
The most obvious choice to start was the LAMP stack so I got familiar with PHP at first.
I use this programming language to this day and I try to keep up with the changes and with the new libraries written in this language.
Because of the LAMP stack, I started to use Linux as my desktop OS as well, in order to get familiar with it as much as I can. I'm really glad that I decided this way, so my Linux knowledge became advanced and I enjoy the big advantage of that in my everyday life as a developer.

I also had the privilege to develop some applications in Go and watch them work in production. I still feel that I could use some guidance with it so I hope, that one day I will be a part of a Go developer team.

I'm also interested in many other aspects of software development like software-architecture, agile methods, standardizing solutions, UNIX systems, etc.
As I mentioned in my job section, I designed and implemented architectures and I learned a lot but I know I could learn more about it with new opportunities and different kinds of problems/circumstances.
I like to make reliable systems around me to keep up the good quality and to do more with less work. That's how I met and dove into agile methods. In application development, being relatively fast is important but being able to estimate is worth gold. So I always try to be alert to catch flaws in the workflow and plan to fix them with teammates in retrospective meetings.
