I assume that you're here to learn about my professional life.  
I was born in 1991 so understanding digital technologies was a crucial part of my childhood.
It became some kind of fascination therefore I chose IT studies in my high school years then I chose  Computer Science as a BSc.

Beside my studies I worked on many projects. I don't count them in my professional years, although I always got paid and I also had responsibilities there. But these experiences definitely helped me to get my first job very easily.

I've always been focusing on web applications from the perspective of backend engineering. As a consequence, I code in PHP mostly. But I also have a few applications in production written in Go.  
What I learnt really well in all these years, that what makes an application reliable so I can take responsibility for it. This knowledge gives me confidence with my work on a daily basis.
