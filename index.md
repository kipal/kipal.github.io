I assume that you're here to learn about my professional life.  
I was born in 1991 so learning and understanding digital technologies was a crucial part of my childhood.
It became some kind of fascination therefore I chose IT studies in my high school years and Computer Science as my major in college.

Beside my studies, I worked on many projects as a student worker. I don't count them in my professional years, although I feel it is worth to mention because I practically had the same responsibilities as junior developers.

My main focus has always been web-based applications, from the perspective of backend engineering. Mostly, I have coded in PHP, as it is one of the most chosen server-side programming languages in Central Europe. But I also have a few applications in production written in Go.

What I learnt really well in all these years that what makes an application reliable so I can take responsibility for it. This knowledge gives me confidence with my work on a daily basis.
