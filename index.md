{:.details}Hello,

{:.details}I assume that you're here to learn about my professional skills. ( If you want to cut it short then you should check out the menu on the left ;)

{:.details}Then let me introduce myself: I'm NÃ¡ndor Kiss from Budapest, Hungary. I was born, raised and educated in this Central European country.

{:.details}From a really young age I have been fascinated by technology on every level when they are useful. I always wonder how they work and why they work on those ways.
I've never missed an opportunity to peek under the roof of any kind of appliances. It became my learning method and I use it gladly to this day.
If there's something I want to know how it works, then I'm going to find out by disassembling it, part after part.
It goes without saying that every now and then, it occured that I wasn't able to reassemble them.
So my parents were really happy when I started to inquiry about softwares where I can fulfill all my deconstructing desires without making a bigger damage in our properties.
I always make these discoveries as fast as I can because I feel an urge to use them, to make something with them to be produtive.

{:.details}So, that would be the short manual to me: **keep me busy, but not bored**.

{:.details}By busy, I mean that I have to be produtive by day-by-day development which seems to be useful in a direct way. And by "not bored", I mean that I have to get the freedom to think about and implement the solutions that make the application/development better.

{:.details}It seems logical to me. So that's the way I like to take responsibility.
