Hello,

I assume that you're here to learn about my professional skills.
Then let me introduce myself: I'm NÃ¡ndor Kiss from Budapest, Hungary. I was born, raised and educated here.

From a really young age I has been fascinated by technology on every level. I always wondered how they work and why they do that on those ways.
I've never missed an option to peek under the roof of any kind of appliances. It became my learning method and I use it gladly to this day.
If there's something I want to know how it works, then I'm going to find out by disassembling it, part after part.
It goes without saying that every now and then, it occured that I wasn't able to reassemble them. So my parents were really happy when I started to inquiry about softwares where I can live through all my deconstructing urges without making a bigger damage in our properties.

That's how I got to know Linux and open source communities.
