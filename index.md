Hello,

I assume that you're here to learn about my professional skills.
Then let me introduce myself: I'm NÃ¡ndor Kiss from Budapest, Hungary. I was born, raised and educated here, in this Central European country.

From a really young age I has been fascinated by technology on every level. I always wondered how they work and why they do that on those ways.
I've never missed an opportunity to peek under the roof of any kind of appliances. It became my learning method and I use it gladly to this day.
If there's something I want to know how it works, then I'm going to find out by disassembling it, part after part.
It goes without saying that every now and then, it occured that I wasn't able to reassemble them.
So my parents were really happy when I started to inquiry about softwares where I can fulfill all my deconstructing desires without making a bigger damage in our properties.

It was an obvious choice to enroll into a high school which can teach me more about information technology.
I learned the basics of almost every branch of IT there but I realized soon that programming is what I like the most.
With some of my classmates, we launched and maintained the school's homepage which was based on some CMS.
That was the time when I started to use PHP and got comfortable with it, even if we just customized some functionality.
For some reason, I started to use Linux on my own machine in those days. I didn't know much about how it works but I never stopped using it.

In 2009, I got enrolled in university as a Computer Scientist candidate.
From the very beginnings, I was able to take student jobs as a Web Developer besides my studies.
Usually, I don't write them down into my CV because they were student jobs but I think they were important.
The issues in those jobs which were all new to me, kept the curiosity alive in me and drived me to find out how they work.


After a couple of years, I was able to see the perks of using it when I got a student job as a web developer.

That's how I got to know Linux and open source communities. I've used Linux since 2007. The most important thing it thought me that
