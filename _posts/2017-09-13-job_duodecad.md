excerpt: PHP Developer

This was my first job where I worked in a agile team with all the tools like
* daily scrum
* retrospective meetings
* estimations
* code reviews
* version control system

The application we developed in PHP was one of the company's product. It's a globally available web application to stream live videos.
It was separated into microservices but at that time we didn't use containers. We deployed the changes into static VMs which were in 5 different DCs around the world.
The heavy load and high availablity imply many problems in distributed systems that we had to solve. That's what I learnt there.
