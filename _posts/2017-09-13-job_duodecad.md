excerpt: PHP Developer

This was my first job where I worked in an agile team with all the tools like
* daily scrum
* retrospective meetings
* estimations
* code reviews
* version control system

We developed the company's own product, mostly in PHP. It's a globally available web application for streaming live videos.
It was separated into microservices but at that time we didn't use containers. We deployed the changes into static VMs which were in 5 different DCs around the world.
What I got to learn there mainly was that how we can handle the heavy load with high availability in distributed systems.
