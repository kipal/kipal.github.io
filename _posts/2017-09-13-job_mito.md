It was an agency where we built web applications for our long-term client, a lottery company.
We delivered solutions from CMS to APIs to cover all of their web appearances.
Another company handled the operation and at this point the architecture was given by them.
Team members and other circumstances changed many times because there were many other clients to work for.
Consequently, agile methodologies couldn't work well so we worked in an own work flow.
