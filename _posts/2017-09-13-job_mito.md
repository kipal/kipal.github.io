Mito is a digital agency where my group built web applications for one of the company's long-term clients.
We delivered solutions from CMS to services to cover all of their web-based solutions and appearances.
Another company handled the operation of the services and at this point the architecture was given by them as my team joined the projects after them and we had a very strict due date.
Team members and other work-related circumstances changed many times because there were many other clients to work for. Therefore, we had to deal with the fluctuation by updating our workflow constantly.
As a result, we had to let go of applying any kind of agile framework as a whole, but only pick their atomic solutions for specific problems and create our own agile method.
