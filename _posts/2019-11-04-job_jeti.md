I may have not learned that much I was working here, though by applying what I have already done before, I feel I contributed to something meaningful as this company is one of the last independent news outlets in Hungary.  

My main focus was to create the basics of a tailor-made e-commerce system to handle different kinds of products from donations to subscriptions through different payment gateways and to produce invoices which apply the current taxation laws. And all of this had to be used easily by other applications with unknown load therefore I chose to separate every bigger chunk of functions into libraries.
