excerpt: Lead-Backend Developer
---
After the promotion, I stayed on the same project but the scope of my responsibility changed.
From that time on, I was able to rethink the old architecture which wasn't working well under heavy load. With the support of the operation, we implemented the new design.
Then we had the opportunity to use Ansible for deployment in the reshaped environment.
As a lead developer, I got to assess our team's workflow and improve it. I started to do retrospective meetings where I was the moderator.
Furthermore, lead developers' issue was to build standard tools/flows to apply them in the whole company to make development faster and more reliable.
So we looked for new technologies, frameworks, libraries. I went for containerization and dockerized many of our applications.
It was crucial in our time because many integrated solutions support Docker containers now. Like Gitlab CI that we started to use to run our tests.
To achieve this, I had to assess what we got there as a current environment and be in persistent collaboration with other departments like operation, management, UX.
