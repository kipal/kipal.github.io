excerpt: Lead-Backend Developer
---
After the promotion I stayed on the same project but the scope of my responsibility changed.
From that time I was able to rethink the old architecture given by the operation. With their support we implemented the new design.
Then we were able to use Ansible for deployment in the reshaped environment.
As a lead developer I got the chance to assess our team's work flow and improve it. I started to do retrospective meetings where I was the moderator.
Furthermore, lead developers' issue was to build standard tools/flows to apply them in the whole company in order to make development faster and more reliable.
So we looked for technologies, framework, libaries. I personally went for containerization and dockerezied many of our applications.
It's crucial in our time because many integrated solutions support Docker containers now. Like Gitlab CI that we started to use to run our tests.
To achieve this, we had to assess what we got there as a current situation and to be in persistent collaboration with other departments like operation, management, UX.
